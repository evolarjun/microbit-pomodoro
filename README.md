## Note!

I gave up on the Make:Code version and switched to micropython even though the Microsoft Make:Code IDE is much fancier. I got frustrated, probably because I started out in the "visual" programming mode so the python code I ended up editing was even messier than my usual. I got something more responsive working in micropython at https://github.com/evolarjun/microbit-pomodoro2.
